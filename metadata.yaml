description: "Regiment of Women is the debut novel of Winifred Ashton writing as Clemence\
  \ Dane. First published in 1917, the novel has gained some notoriety due to its\
  \ more or less veiled treatment of lesbian relationships inside and outside a school\
  \ setting. It is said to have inspired Radclyffe Hall to write The Well of Loneliness.\n\
